           SHORT="Fairly Usable cli Filebrowser"

cat << EOF
Another cli filebrowser made with the following ideas:
 - async loading of directories and previews that you can cancel
 - more vim movement keybinds
 - handling of opening and previewing files done by external scripts for easy configuration
 - more respect for LS_COLORS
 - no fancy file edit operations, at most drop to shell
 - no fancy in depth configuration besides the scripts
 - minimize hanging due to unneeded disk io.
