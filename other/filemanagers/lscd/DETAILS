cat << EOF
lscd is a file browser with close integration with the unix shell.
Features:
 - written in shell script, so you never really leave the shell
 - text-based graphical user interface
 - no dependencies except a POSIX shell and core utils
 - controlled with arrow keys and some vim-like shortcuts
 - may be sourced to run in the current shell environment (using ". lscd")
 - when sourced, it moves you to the last opened directory on exit
 - may call an arbitrary file opener; uses "less" or ranger's "rifle" by default
