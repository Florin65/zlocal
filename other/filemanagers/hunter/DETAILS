           SHORT="A ranger-like file browser written in rust"

cat << EOF
hunter is a fast and lag-free file browser/manager for the terminal.
It features a heavily asynchronous and multi-threaded design and all disk IO
happens off the main thread in a non-blocking fashion, so that hunter will
always stay responsive, even under heavy load on a slow spinning rust disk,
even with all the previews enabled.
