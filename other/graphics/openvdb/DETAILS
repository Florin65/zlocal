A large suite of tools for the efficient storage and manipulation of sparse
volumetric data discretized on three-dimensional grids.
OpenVDB is an open source C++ library comprising a novel hierarchical data
structure and a large suite of tools for the efficient storage and manipulation
of sparse volumetric data discretized on three-dimensional grids. It is
developed and maintained by DreamWorks Animation for use in volumetric
applications typically encountered in feature film production.
