cat << EOF
mtm is the Micro Terminal Multiplexer, a terminal multiplexer.
It has four major features/princples:
Simplicity
  There are only a few commands, two of which are hardly ever used.
  There are no modes, no dozens of commands, no crazy feature list.
Compatibility
  mtm emulates a classic ANSI text terminal. That means it should work out of
  the box on essentially all terminfo/termcap-based systems (even pretty old
  ones), without needing to install a new termcap entry.
Size
  mtm is small. The entire project is around 1000 lines of code.
Stability
   mtm is "finished" as it is now. You don't need to worry about it changing on
   you unexpectedly. The only changes that can happen at this point are:
      Bug fixes.
      Translation improvements.
      Accessibility improvements.
      Fixes to keep it working on modern OSes.
