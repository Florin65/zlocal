           SHORT="Minimal terminal emulator based on VTE"

cat << EOF
The terminal emulator to end all terminals emulators: an extremely minimal
terminal primarily meant to be used with tmux.
You probably won't like its biggest feature: the lack of most features other
terminal emulators have, while containing some features I want.
