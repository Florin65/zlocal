UFO: ALIEN INVASION is a squad-based tactical strategy game in the tradition of
the old X-COM PC games, but with a twist. Our game combines military realism
with hard science-fiction and the weirdness of an alien invasion. The carefully
constructed turn-based system gives you pin-point control of your squad while
maintaining a sense of pace and danger.
