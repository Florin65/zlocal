           SHORT="A Markdown implementation written in C"

cat << EOF
This is an implementation of text to html language. There’s not much here that
differentiates it from any of the existing Markdown implementations except that
it’s written in C instead of one of the vast flock of scripting languages that
are fighting it out for the Perl crown.
Markdown provides a library that gives you formatting functions suitable for
marking down entire documents or lines of text, a command-line program that you
can use to mark down documents interactively or from a script, and a tiny (3
programs so far) suite of example programs that show how to fully utilize the
markdown library.
