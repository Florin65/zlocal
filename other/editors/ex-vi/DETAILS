cat << EOF
The vi editor is one of the most common text editors on Unix. It was developed
starting around 1976 by Bill Joy at UCB, who was tired of the ed editor.
Compared to most of its many clones, the original vi is a rather small program
(~120 KB code on i386) just with its extremely powerful editing interface, but
lacking fancy features like multiple undo, multiple screens or syntax
highlighting. In other words, it is a typical Unix program that does exactly
what it should and nothing more.
