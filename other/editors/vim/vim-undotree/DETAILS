cat << EOF
Vim stores undo history in a tree. This plug-in will free you from using
commands and bring back the power of undo tree.
Features:
1. Visualize undo-tree
  - The undo history is sorted based on the changes' timestamp.
    The year/month/day field will not be displayed if the changes were made
    within the same day.
  - The change sequence number is displayed before timestamp.
  - The current position is marked as >seq<.
  - The next change that will be restored by :redo or <ctrl-r> is marked as
    {seq}, it's the same as curhead returned by undotree()
  - The [seq] marks the last change and where further changes will be added,
    it's the same as newhead returned by undotree()
  - Saved changes are marked as s and the capitalized S indicates the last
    saved change.
2. Live updated diff panel.
3. Highlight for added and changed text.
4. Revert to a specific change by a single mouse click or key stroke.
5. Customizable hotkeys and highlighting.
6. Display changes in diff panel.
