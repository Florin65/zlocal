cat << EOF
This script allows you to use your normal tab settings for the beginning of the
line, and have tabs expanded as spaces anywhere else.
This effectively distinguishes 'indent' from 'alignment'.
<tab>  Uses editor tab settings to insert a tab at the beginning of the line
       (before the first non-space character), and inserts spaces otherwise.
<BS>   Uses editor tab settings to delete tabs or 'expanded' tabs ala smarttab.

:RetabIndent[!] [tabstop] - This is similar to the :retab command, with the
exception that it affects all and only whitespace at the start of the line,
changing it to suit your current (or new) tabstop and expandtab setting. With
the bang (!) at the end, the command also strips trailing whitespace.
