           SHORT="Reopen files at your last edit position in Vim"

cat << EOF
Intelligently reopen files at your last edit position. By default git, svn, and
mercurial commit messages are ignored because you probably want to type a new
message and not re-edit the previous one.
Advantages over the snippets that can be found around the net include:
- Commit messages automatically start at the beginning of a file.
  This is important because many version control systems re-use the same file
  for commit message editing.
- Maximizes Available Context
- Center the cursor vertically after restoring last edit position.
- Keep as much of the file on screen as possible when last edit position is at
  the end of the file.
- Opens folds if the last edit position is inside a fold.
- Works properly with new file templates and scripts that jump to a specific
  line in them.
