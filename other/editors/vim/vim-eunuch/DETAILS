cat << EOF
Vim sugar for the UNIX shell commands that need it the most. Features include:
:Remove:    Delete a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
:Unlink:    Like :Remove, but keeps the now empty buffer.
:Move:      Rename a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
:Rename:    Like :Move, but relative to the current file's containing directory.
:Chmod:     Change the permissions of the current file.
:Mkdir:     Create a directory, defaulting to the parent of the current file.
:Find:      Run find and load the results into the quickfix list.
:Locate:    Run locate and load the results into the quickfix list.
:Wall:      Write every open window. Handy for kicking off tools like guard.
:SudoWrite: Write a privileged file with sudo.
:SudoEdit:  Edit a privileged file with sudo.

File type detection for sudo -e is based on original file name.
New files created with a shebang line are automatically made executable.
New init scripts are automatically prepopulated with /etc/init.d/skeleton.
