cat << EOF
Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air.
Features:
  - Tiny core written with extensibility in mind (open/closed principle).
  - Integrates with a variety of plugins, including: vim-bufferline, fugitive,
    unite, ctrlp, minibufexpl, gundo, undotree, nerdtree, tagbar, vim-gitgutter,
    vim-signify, quickfixsigns, syntastic, eclim, lawrencium, virtualenv,
    tmuxline, taboo.vim, ctrlspace and more.
  - Looks good with regular fonts and provides configuration points so you can
    use unicode or powerline symbols.
  - Optimized for speed; it loads in under a millisecond.
  - Extensive suite of themes for popular color schemes including solarized
    (dark and light), tomorrow (all variants), base16 (all variants), molokai,
    jellybeans and others. Note these are now external to this plugin.
  - Supports 7.2 as the minimum Vim version.
  - The master branch tries to be as stable as possible, and new features are
    merged in only after they have gone through a full regression test.
  - Unit testing suite.
