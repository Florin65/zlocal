You can use this plugin's basic functionality to set up a list of frequently
accessed files for easy navigation. The list of files will be displayed in a
window on the left side of the Vim window, and you can press <Return> or
double-click on filenames in the list to open the files. This is similar to
how some IDEs I've used work. It is easier to use than having to navigate a
directory hierarchy with the file-explorer. It also obviates the need for a
buffer explorer because you have your list of files on the left of the Vim
Window.
