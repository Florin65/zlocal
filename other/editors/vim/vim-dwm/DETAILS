cat << EOF
dwm.vim adds tiled window management capabilities to Vim.
Windows are always organised as follows: 

========================== 
|              |    S1   | 
|              |========== 
|      M       |    S2   | 
|              |========== 
|              |    S3   | 
========================== 

Use the following commands to create, close and browse windows: 
  - CTRL-N Creates a new window and place it in the area [M] & stacks al
    previous windows in the [S] areas. 
  - CTRL-C Close the current window if no unsaved changes 
  - CTRL-J Jumps to next window (clockwise) 
  - CTRL-K Jumps to previous window (anti-clockwise) 
  - CTRL-H Focus the current window, that is, place it in the [M] area & stacks
    all other windows in the [S] areas
