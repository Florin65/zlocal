Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal set of
defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.
 - If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather than
   copying some random vimrc you found.
 - If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use, this
   can be your neutral territory.
 - If you're administrating a server with an account that's not exclusively
   yours, you can scp this up to make things a bit more tolerable.
 - If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from your
   vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic amenities.
