cat << EOF
When combined with a set of tmux key bindings, the plugin will allow you to
navigate seamlessly between vim and tmux splits using a consistent set of
hotkeys.
This plugin provides the following mappings which allow you to move between Vim
panes and tmux splits seamlessly.
<ctrl-h> => Left
<ctrl-j> => Down
<ctrl-k> => Up
<ctrl-l> => Right
<ctrl-\> => Previous split
Note - you don't need to use your tmux prefix key sequence before using the
mappings.
