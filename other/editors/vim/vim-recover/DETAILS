           SHORT="A Vim plugin to show a diff, whenever recovering a buffer"

cat << EOF
When editing files with Vim and one trips about existing swap files, it is
hard to tell what has been changed between the swap file and the actual on
disk version. The aim of this plugin is to have an easy way to see differences
between the swap files and the files stored on disk.

Therefore this plugin sets up an auto command that will create a diff buffer
between the recovered file and the on-disk version of the same file. You can
easily see what has been changed and save your recovered work back to the file
on disk.

By default this plugin is enabled. To disable it, use :RecoverPluginDisable.
To enable this plugin again, use :RecoverPluginEnable
