cat << EOF
Supertab is a neovim plugin which allows you to use <Tab> for all your insert
completion needs (:help ins-completion).
Features:
- Configurable to suit you needs:
  - Default completion type to use.
  - Prevent <Tab> from completing after/before defined patterns.
  - Close vim's completion preview window when code completion is finished.
  - When using other completion types, you can configure how long to 'remember'
    the current completion type before returning to the default.
  - Don't like using <Tab>? You can also configure a different pair of keys to
    scroll forwards and backwards through completion results.
- Optional improved 'longest' completion support (after typing some characters,
  hitting <Tab> will highlight the next longest match).
- Built in 'context' completion option which chooses the appropriate completion
  type based on the text preceding the cursor.
  - You can also plug in your own functions to determine which completion type
    to use.
- Support for simple completion chaining (falling back to a different completion
  type, keyword completion for example, if omni or user completion returns no
  results).
