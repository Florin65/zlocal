cat << EOF
Fennel (formerly fnl) is a lisp that compiles to Lua. It aims to be easy to use,
expressive, and has almost zero overhead compared to handwritten Lua.
Features:
  Full Lua compatibility - You can use any function or library from Lua.
  Zero overhead - Compiled code should be just as or more efficient than
               and-written Lua.
  Compile-time macros - Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency on Fennel.
  Embeddable - Fennel is a one-file library as well as an executable.
               Embed it in other programs to support runtime extensibility and
               interactive development.
