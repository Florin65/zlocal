GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Austin Kyoto Common Lisp) is
a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp. GCL is very portable and
extremely efficient on a wide class of applications, and compares
favorably in performance with commercial Lisps on several large
theorem--prover and symbolic algebra systems. GCL supports the
CLtL1 specification.
