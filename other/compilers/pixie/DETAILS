           SHORT="A small, fast, native lisp with 'magical' powers"

cat << EOF
Pixie is a lightweight lisp suitable for both general use as well as shell
scripting. The language is still in a "pre-alpha" phase and as such changes
fairly quickly. The standard library is heavily inspired by Clojure as well
as several other functional programming languages. It is written in RPython
and as such supports a fairly fast GC and an amazingly fast tracing JIT.
Some planned and implemented features:
  - Immutable datastructures
  - Protocols first implementation
  - Transducers at-the-bottom (most primitives are based off of reduce)
  - A "good enough" JIT (implemented, tuning still a WIP, but not bad
    performance today)
  - Easy FFI
  - Pattern matching (TODO).
