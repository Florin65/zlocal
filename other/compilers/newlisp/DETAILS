cat << EOF
newLISP is a Lisp-like, general-purpose scripting language. It is especially
well-suited for applications in AI, simulation, natural language processing,
big data, machine learning and statistics.
Because of its small resource requirements, newLISP is excellent for embedded
systems applications.
Most of the functions you will ever need are already built in. This includes
networking functions, support for distributed and multicore processing, and
Bayesian statistics.
