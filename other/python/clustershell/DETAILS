cat << EOF
ClusterShell is an event-driven open source Python library, designed to run
local or distant commands in parallel on server farms or on large Linux
clusters. No need to reinvent the wheel: you can use ClusterShell as a building
block to create cluster aware administration scripts and system applications in
Python.
It will take care of common issues encountered on HPC clusters, such as
operating on groups of nodes, running distributed commands using optimized
execution algorithms, as well as gathering results and merging identical
outputs, or retrieving return codes. ClusterShell takes advantage of existing
remote shell facilities already installed on your systems, like SSH.
