smem is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux systems.
Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size (PSS), which is a
more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used by libraries and
applications in a virtual memory system.
Because large portions of physical memory are typically shared among multiple
applications, the standard measure of memory usage known as resident set size
(RSS) will significantly overestimate memory usage. PSS instead measures each
application's "fair share" of each shared area to give a realistic measure.
smem has many features:
  system overview listing
  listings by process, mapping, user
  filtering by process, mapping, or user
  configurable columns from multiple data sources
  configurable output units and percentages
  configurable headers and totals
  reading live data from /proc
  reading data snapshots from directory mirrors or compressed tarballs
  lightweight capture tool for embedded systems
  built-in chart generation
