cat << EOF
reclass is an “external node classifier” (ENC) as can be used with automation
tools, such as Puppet, Salt, and Ansible. It is also a stand-alone tool for
merging data sources recursively.
The purpose of an ENC is to allow a system administrator to maintain an
inventory of nodes to be managed, completely separately from the configuration
of the automation tool. Usually, the external node classifier completely
replaces the tool-specific inventory.

With respect to the configuration management tool, the ENC then fulfills two
jobs:
  - it provides information about groups of nodes and group memberships
  - it gives access to node-specific information, such as variables

reclass allows you to define your nodes through class inheritance, while always
able to override details further up the tree (i.e. in more specific nodes).
Think of classes as feature sets, as commonalities between nodes, or as tags.
Add to that the ability to nest classes (multiple inheritance is allowed,
well-defined, and encouraged), and you can assemble your infrastructure from
smaller bits, eliminating duplication and exposing all important parameters to a
single location, logically organised. And if that isn’t enough, reclass lets you
reference other parameters in the very hierarchy you are currently assembling.
