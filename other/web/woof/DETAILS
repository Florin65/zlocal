Woof (Web Offer One File) assumes that everybody has a web-browser or a
commandline web-client installed. Woof is a small simple stupid webserver
that can easily be invoked on a single file. Your partner can access the
file with tools he trusts (e.g. wget). No need to enter passwords on
keyboards where you don't know about keyboard sniffers, no need to start
a huge lot of infrastructure, just do a

     $ woof filename

and tell the recipient the URL woof spits out. When he got that file, woof
will quit and everything is done.
And when someone wants to send you a file, woof has a switch to offer itself,
so he can get woof and offer a file to you.
