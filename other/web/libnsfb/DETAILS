           SHORT="A framebuffer abstraction library"

cat <<EOF
LibNSFB is a framebuffer abstraction library, written in C.
The overall idea of the library is to provide a generic abstraction to a linear
section of memory which corresponds to a visible array of pixel elements on a
display device. Different colour depths are supported and the library provides
routines for tasks such as drawing onto the framebuffer and rectangle copy
operations.
LibNSFB currently supports the following as framebuffer providers:
  Linux framebuffer
  X
  SDL
  VNC
  ABLE framebuffer.
