cat << EOF
Vimb is a fast and lightweight vim like web browser based on the webkit web
browser engine and the GTK toolkit. Vimb is modal like the great vim editor and
also easily configurable during runtime. Vimb is mostly keyboard driven and does
not detract you from your daily work.
If your are familiar with vim or have some experience with pentadactyl the use
of vimb would be a breeze, if not we missed our target.
