cat <<EOF
Hubbub is an HTML5 compliant parsing library, written in C.
The HTML5 specification defines a parsing algorithm, based on the behaviour of
mainstream browsers, which provides instructions for how to parse all markup,
both valid and invalid. As a result, Hubbub parses web content well.
Features:
  Parses HTML, good and bad
  Simple C API
  Fast
  Character encoding detection
  Well-tested (~90% test coverage)
  Portable
  Shared library.
