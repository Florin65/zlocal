cat << EOF
libasr is a free, simple and portable asynchronous resolver library.
It allows to run dns queries and perform hostname resolutions in a fully
asynchronous fashion. The implementation is thread-less, fork-less, and does
not make use of signals or other "tricks" that might get in the developer's way.
