msmtp is an SMTP client.
In the default mode, it transmits a mail to an SMTP server (for example at a
free mail provider) which takes care of further delivery. To use this program
with your mail user agent (MUA), create a configuration file with your mail
account(s) and tell your MUA to call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail.
Features include:
  Sendmail compatible interface (command line options and exit codes)
  Support for multiple accounts
  TLS/SSL support including client certificates
  Many authentication methods
  Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
  Fast SMTP implementation using command pipelining
  DSN (Delivery Status Notification) support
  SOCKS proxy support
