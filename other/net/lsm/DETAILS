LSM is a Link Status Monitor which can be used to monitor for example a Linux
router/firewall connectivity and if you happen to have multiple connections
it can change routing when an up/down event happens by utilizing external
script. When a SIGUSR1 is received current connection states are syslogged.
This package is highly influenced by fping and iputils arping.
