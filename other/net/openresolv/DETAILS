cat << EOF
etc/resolv.conf is a file that holds the configuration for the local resolution
of domain names. Normally this file is either static or maintained by a local
daemon, normally a DHCP daemon.
But what happens if more than one thing wants to control the file? Say you have
wired and wireless interfaces to different subnets and run a VPN or two on top
of that, how do you say which one controls the file?
It's also not as easy as just adding and removing the nameservers each client
knows about as different clients could add the same nameservers.
Enter resolvconf, the middleman between the network configuration services and
/etc/resolv.conf. resolvconf itself is just a script that stores, removes and
lists a full resolv.conf generated for the interface. It then calls all the
helper scripts it knows about so it can configure the real /etc/resolv.conf and
optionally any local nameservers other than libc.
Reasons for using openresolv:
  Works with POSIX shell and userland
  Does not need awk, grep or sed which means we can work without /usr mounted
  Works with other init systems than Debians' out of the box
  Available as a 2 clause BSD license
  Prefer configs via IF_METRIC for dynamic ordering
  Configures zones for local resolvers other than libc.
