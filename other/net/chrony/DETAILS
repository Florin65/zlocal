chrony is a versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
It can synchronise the system clock with NTP servers, reference clocks, and
manual input using wristwatch and keyboard. It can also operate as an NTPv4
(RFC 5905) server and peer to provide a time service to other computers in the
network.
It is designed to perform well in a wide range of conditions, including
intermittent network connections, heavily congested networks, changing
temperatures (ordinary computer clocks are sensitive to temperature), and
systems that do not run continuosly, or run on a virtual machine.
Typical accuracy between two machines synchronised over the Internet is within
a few milliseconds; on a LAN, accuracy is typically in tens of microseconds.
With hardware timestamping, or a hardware reference clock, sub-microsecond
accuracy may be possible.
Two programs are included in chrony, chronyd is a daemon that can be started at
boot time and chronyc is a command-line interface program which can be used to
monitor chronydâ€™s performance and to change various operating parameters whilst
it is running.
