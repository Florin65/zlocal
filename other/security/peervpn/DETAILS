PeerVPN is a software that builds virtual ethernet networks between multiple
computers. Such a virtual network can be useful to facilitate direct
communication that applications like file sharing or gaming may need.
A virtual network built by PeerVPN uses a full mesh topology. All nodes talk
directly to each other, there is no need for a central server. If one node goes
down, the rest of the network is unaffected.
