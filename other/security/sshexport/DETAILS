This script tries to export ssh public keys to specified sites. It will walk you
through generating key pairs if it doesn't find any to export. It handles all
the fiddly details like making sure local and remote permissions are correct,
and tells you what it's doing if it has to change anything. Unlike some competing
tools, you only have to enter your password once.
