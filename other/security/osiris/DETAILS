Osiris is a Host Integrity Monitoring System that periodically monitors one or
more hosts for change. It maintains detailed logs of changes to the file system,
user and group lists, resident kernel modules, and more.
Osiris can be configured to email these logs to the administrator.
Hosts are periodically scanned and, if desired, the records can be maintained
for forensic purposes. Osiris keeps an administrator apprised of possible attacks
and/or nasty little trojans. The purpose here is to isolate changes that indicate
a break-in or a compromised system.
Osiris makes use of OpenSSL for encryption and authentication in all components.
