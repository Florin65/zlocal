           SHORT="A better transparent encryption filesystem"

cat << EOF
securefs is a filesystem in userspace (FUSE) that transparently encrypts and
authenticates data stored. It is particularly designed to secure data stored in
the cloud.
securefs mounts a regular directory onto a mount point. The mount point appears
as a regular filesystem, where one can read/write/create files, directories and
symbolic links. The underlying directory will be automatically updated to contain
the encrypted and authenticated contents.
Compared to TrueCrypt, Apple's encrypted DMG or EncFS, securefs has the following
advantages:
  Randomized encryption
  Authenticated encryption.
