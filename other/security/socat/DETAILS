cat << EOF
socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data
channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device (serial line
etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an
SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU
line editor (readline), a program, or a combination of two of these.
These modes include generation of "listening" sockets, named pipes, and pseudo
terminals.
socat can be used, e.g., as TCP port forwarder (one-shot or daemon), as an
external socksifier, for attacking weak firewalls, as a shell interface to UNIX
sockets, IP6 relay, for redirecting TCP oriented programs to a serial line, to
logically connect serial lines on different computers, or to establish a
relatively secure environment (su and  chroot) for running client or server
shell scripts with network connections.
