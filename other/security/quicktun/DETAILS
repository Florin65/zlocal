cat << EOF
QuickTun is probably the simplest VPN tunnel software ever, yet it's very secure.
It relies on the NaCl encryption library.
QuickTun uses the curve25519xsalsa20poly1305 crypto-box functionality of the NaCl
library for secure public-key encryption.
And that's about all QuickTun does; encrypting and sending data. No fancy
features which would only lead to bloating the binary. In fact, QuickTun itself
has only a few hundred lines of pure C code, making it dead simple to maintain,
analyze, debug and fix.
