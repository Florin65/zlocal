cat << EOF
fswatch is a file change monitor that receives notifications when the contents
of the specified files or directories are modified. fswatch implements four
kinds of monitors:
  A monitor based on the File System Events API of Apple OS X.
  A monitor based on kqueue, a notification interface for *BDS systems. 
  A monitor based on the File Events Notification API of the Solaris kernel and
  its derivatives.
  A monitor based on inotify, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file system
  changes to applications.
  A monitor based on ReadDirectoryChangesW, a Microsoft Windows API that reports
  changes to a directory.
  A monitor which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification
  times in memory, and manually calculates file system changes (which works
  anywhere stat can be used).
