cat <<EOF
This PAM module provides single sign-on behavior for SSH. The user types an SSH
passphrase when logging in (probably to GDM, KDM, or XDM) and is authenticated
if the passphrase successfully decrypts the user's SSH private key. In the PAM
session phase, an ssh-agent process is started and keys are added.
For the entire session, the user can SSH to other hosts that accept key
authentication without typing any passwords.
