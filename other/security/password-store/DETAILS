Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With pass, each
password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title of the
website or resource that requires the password.
These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies,
copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard
command line file management utilities.

pass makes managing these individual password files extremely easy. All passwords
live in ~/.password-store, and pass provides some nice commands for adding,
editing, generating, and retrieving passwords. It is a very short and simple
shell script. It's capable of temporarily putting passwords on your clipboard and
tracking password changes using git.

You can edit the password store using ordinary unix shell commands alongside the
pass command. There are no funky file formats or new paradigms to learn. There is
bash completion so that you can simply hit tab to fill in names and commands.
