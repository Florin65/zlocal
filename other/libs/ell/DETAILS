cat << EOF
The Embedded Linux* Library (ELL) provides core, low-level functionality for
system daemons. It typically has no dependencies other than the Linux kernel,
C standard library, and libdl (for dynamic linking). While ELL is designed to
be efficient and compact enough for use on embedded Linux platforms, it is not
limited to resource-constrained systems.
