cat << EOF
libConfuse is a configuration file parser library written in C. It supports
sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other
sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted
strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include
statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability to a
program using a simple API.
