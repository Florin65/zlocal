cat << EOF
uClibc-ng is a small C library for developing embedded Linux systems. It is much
smaller than the GNU C Library, but nearly all applications supported by glibc
also work perfectly with uClibc-ng.
Porting applications from glibc to uClibc-ng typically involves just recompiling
the source code. uClibc-ng supports shared libraries and threading. It currently
runs on standard Linux and MMU-less (also known as uClinux) systems with support
for Aarch64, Alpha, ARC, ARM, AVR32, Blackfin, CRIS, C-Sky, C6X, FR-V, H8/300,
HPPA, i386, IA64, LM32, M68K/Coldfire, Metag, Microblaze, MIPS, MIPS64, NDS32,
NIOS2, OpenRISC, PowerPC, Sparc, Sparc64, SuperH, Tile, X86_64 and XTENSA
processors.
