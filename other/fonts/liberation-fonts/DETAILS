There are three sets: Sans (a substitute for Arial, Albany, Helvetica,
Nimbus Sans L, and Bitstream Vera Sans), Serif (a substitute for Times
New Roman, Thorndale, Nimbus Roman, and Bitstream Vera Serif) and Mono
(a substitute for Courier New, Cumberland, Courier, Nimbus Mono L, and
Bitstream Vera Sans Mono). The fonts are now available for you to
install.
You are free to use these fonts on any system you would like. You are
free to redistribute them under the GPL+exception license found in the
download. Using these fonts does not subject your documents to the
GPL--it liberates them from any proprietary claim.
