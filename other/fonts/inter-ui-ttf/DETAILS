cat << EOF
Inter UI is a typeface specially designed for user interfaces with focus on
high legibility of small-to-medium sized text on computer screens.
The family features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and
lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like
contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of
surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from
"o", tabular numbers, etc.
