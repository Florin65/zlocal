Ionicons is a completely open-source icon set with 700+ icons crafted for web,
iOS, Android, and desktop apps. Ionicons was built for Ionic Framework, so
icons have both Material Design and iOS versions. When used with Ionic, the
ion-icon component will automatically use the correct version based on your
platform. Additionally, when used outside of Ionic, both ios and md platforms
can be chosen by the application.
