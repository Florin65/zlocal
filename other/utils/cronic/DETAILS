The Cure:
0 1 * * * cronic backup

Cronic is a shell script to help control the most annoying feature of cron:
unwanted emailed output, or "cram" (cron spam).
Cronic is a small shim shell script for wrapping cron jobs so that cron only
sends email when an error has occurred. Cronic defines an error as any non-trace
error output or a non-zero result code. Cronic filters Bash execution traces (or
anything matching PS4) from the error output, so jobs can be run with execution
tracing to aid forensic debugging. Cronic has no options, it simply executes its
arguments.
