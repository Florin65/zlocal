Dateutils are a bunch of tools that revolve around fiddling with dates and
times in the command line with a strong focus on use cases that arise when
dealing with large amounts of financial data.
Dateutils commands are prefixed with a d but otherwise resemble known unix
commands for reasons of intuition. The only exception being strptime which
is analogous to the libc function of the same name:
  strptime  Command line version of the C function
  dateadd   Add durations to dates or times
  dateconv  Convert dates or times between calendars
  datediff  Compute durations between dates or times
  dategrep  Grep dates or times in input streams
  dateround Round dates or times to “fuller” values
  dateseq   Generate sequences of dates or times
  datetest  Compare dates or times
  datezone  Convert date/times to timezones in bulk
