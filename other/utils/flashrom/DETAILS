cat << EOF
flashrom is a utility for detecting, reading, writing, verifying and erasing
flash chips. It is often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware images
in-system using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of network
cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which can
program flash chips.
It supports a wide range of flash chips (most commonly found in SOIC8, DIP8,
SOIC16, WSON8, PLCC32, DIP32, TSOP32, and TSOP40 packages), which use various
protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel flash, or SPI.
