Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, netstat and ifstat.
Dstat overcomes some of their limitations and adds some extra features, more
counters and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring systems during
performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting.
Dstat allows you to view all of your system resources in real-time, you can eg.
compare disk utilization in combination with interrupts from your IDE
controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly with the disk
throughput (in the same interval).
