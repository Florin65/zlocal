direnv is an environment switcher for the shell. It knows how to hook into
bash, zsh, tcsh, fish shell and elvish to load or unload environment variables
depending on the current directory. This allows project-specific environmentxi
 variables without cluttering the ~/.profile file.
Before each prompt, direnv checks for the existence of a ".envrc" file in the
current and parent directories. If the file exists (and is authorized), it is
loaded into a bash sub-shell and all exported variables are then captured by
direnv and then made available to the current shell.
