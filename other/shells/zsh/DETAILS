Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells most
resembles the Korn shell (ksh). It includes enhancements of many types, notably
in the command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour, filename
globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and extra
features drawn from tcsh.
