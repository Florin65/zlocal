Tomb is an 100% free and open source system for file encryption on GNU/Linux,
facilitating the backup of secret files. Tomb is written in code that is easy
to review and links commonly shared components.
Tomb generates encrypted storage folders to be opened and closed using their
associated keyfiles, which are also protected with a password chosen by the
user. A tomb is like a locked folder that can be safely transported and hidden
in a filesystem; its keys can be kept separate, for instance keeping the tomb
file on your computer harddisk and the key files on a USB stick.
