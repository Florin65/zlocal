Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine
(and the CLR, and JavaScript).
It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability
and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and
robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled
language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic.
Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides
easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference,
to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy
and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming
language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.
When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory
system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded
designs.
