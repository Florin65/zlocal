Redo is a build system for software packages that does incremental builds, i.e.
if the package is built and then some of its source files are changed, the build
system will only re-run that part of the build procedure that is necessary
to re-build the changed parts of the package.
Redo-sh is an implementation of redo in Bourne Shell (bash).
