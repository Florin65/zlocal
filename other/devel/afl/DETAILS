cat << EOF
American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a novel type of
compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover
clean, interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted
binary. This substantially improves the functional coverage for the fuzzed code.
The compact synthesized corpora produced by the tool are also useful for seeding
other, more labor- or resource-intensive testing regimes down the road.
