cat << EOF
ConsoleKit2 is a framework for defining and tracking users, login sessions, and
seats. It allows multiple users to be logged in at the same time and share
hardware for their graphical session. ConsoleKit2 will keep track of those
resources and whichever session is active will have use of the hardware at that
time.
A seat is a collection of sessions and a set of hardware (usually at least a
keyboard and mouse). Only one session may be active on a seat at a time.
A session is a collection of all processes that originate from a single common
ancestor and retain knowledge of a secret.
