cat << EOF
Gives a fake root environment, to remove the need to become root for a package
build. fakeroot runs a command in an environment where it appears to have root
privileges for file manipulation.
This is useful for allowing users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb etc.) with
files in them with root permissions/ownership. Without fakeroot one would have
to have root privileges to create the constituent files of the archives with
the correct permissions and ownership, and then pack them up, or one would have
to construct the archives directly, without using the archiver.
