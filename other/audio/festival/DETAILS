cat << EOF
Festival offers a general framework for building speech synthesis systems as
well as including examples of various modules. As a whole it offers full tex
to speech through a number APIs: from shell level, though a Scheme comman
interpreter, as a C++ library, from Java, and an Emacs interface. Festival is
multi-lingual (currently English (British and American), and Spanish) though
English is the most advanced. Other groups release new languages for the system.
