The PCI Utilities package contains a library for portable access to PCI
bus configuration space and several utilities based on this library.
Current version works only on Linux, but it can be easily extended to
work on other systems as well.
The utilities include: (See manual pages for more details)
  lspci:  displays detailed information about all PCI busses and
          devices in the system, replacing the original /proc/pci
          interface.
  setpci: allows to read from and write to PCI device
          configuration registers. For example, you can adjust
          the latency timers with it.
