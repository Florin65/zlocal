           SHORT="A highly capable, feature-rich programming language"

cat << EOF
Perl is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that makes easy
things easy and hard things possible. It is optimized for scanning arbitrary
text files and system administration.
It has built-in extended regular expression matching and replacement, a dataflow
mechanism to improve security with setuid scripts and is extendable via modules
that can interface to C libraries.
