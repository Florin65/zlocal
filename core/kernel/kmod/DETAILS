cat << EOF
The goal of the new library libkmod is to offer to other programs the needed
flexibility and fine grained control over insertion, removal, configuration
and listing of kernel modules. Using the library, with simple pieces of code
it's possible to interact with kernel modules and then there's no need to
rely on other tools for that.
