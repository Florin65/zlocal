The program provides graphical user interface to control the connman daemon.
The connman daemon must be started as you normally would, this program just
interfaces with that daemon. You can see what technologies and services connman
has found, and for wifi services an agent is registered to assist in obtainingxi
 the information from you necessary to logon the wifi service.
