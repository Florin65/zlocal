The execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file;
the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.
execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops, getopt-style
option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more
logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has no security issues.
