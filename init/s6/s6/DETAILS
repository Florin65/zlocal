           SHORT="A suite of programs, designed to allow process supervision"

cat << EOF
s6 is a small suite of programs for UNIX, designed to allow process supervision
(a.k.a service supervision), in the line of daemontools and runit, as well as
various operations on processes and daemons. It is meant to be a toolbox for
low-level process and service administration, providing different sets of
independent tools that can be used within or without the framework, and that can
be assembled together to achieve powerful functionality with a very small amount
of code.
Things you can do by assembling together several programs provided by s6
besides process supervision:
- syslogd functionality, using much less resources than the traditional syslogd.
- Reliable service readiness notification, which is the basis for service
  dependency management.
- Controlled privileged gain as with sudo, without using any suid programs.
- The useful parts of socket activation without having to change application
  code or link servers against any specific library, and without having to
  switch to any specific init system.
