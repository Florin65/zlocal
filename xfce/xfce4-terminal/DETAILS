cat << EOF
xfce4-terminal is a modern terminal emulator for the Linux desktop primarily for
the Xfce desktop environment. We developed it because we saw the need for a
lightweight and easy-to-use terminal emulator in the Xfce desktop environment,
that doesn't require the user to install the GNOME platform, but still provides
a worthy alternative to the GNOME terminal emulator.
