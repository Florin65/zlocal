Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce. When you open it
you are shown a list of applications you have marked as favorites. You can
browse through all of your installed applications by clicking on the category
buttons on the side. Top level categories make browsing fast, and simple to
switch between.
Additionally, Whisker Menu keeps a list of the last ten applications that
you've launched from it.
Favorites are easy to add and reorder. When browsing through your applications,
right-click on any of them and select "Add to Favorites". Simply drag and drop
your favorites list to arrange them to suit your needs. You can remove them at
any time from another right-click option.
If you're not sure exactly where a program is listed, instead of browsing
through each category you can simply enter a search term. The search field is
focused when opening the menu, so you can just start typing.
Application descriptions as well as names are searched, which allows you to
find a program by using a general word (such as "browser" to find all web
browsers installed on your computer).
